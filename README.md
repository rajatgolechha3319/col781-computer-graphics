## Assignments

### üé® A1: Software Rasterizer

This assignment implements a software rasterizer from the ground up. A rasterizer is a core component of the graphics pipeline that transforms 3D vector graphics into a 2D raster image (a grid of pixels) for display.

**Key concepts explored:**
* Triangle rasterization
* Barycentric coordinates
* Z-buffering for depth testing
* Shading models (e.g., Blinn-Phong , Phong)

***

### üï∏Ô∏è A2: Mesh Processing

This project delves into algorithms for processing and manipulating 3D geometric meshes. Mesh processing is a vital area in 3D modeling, computer-aided design, and geometry processing.

**Key concepts explored:**
* Data structures for representing meshes
* Mesh simplification and subdivision
* Mesh smoothing and fairing
* Geometric property calculations (e.g., curvature)

### ‚ú® A3: Path Tracing

This assignment implements a path tracer, a powerful physically-based rendering technique. By simulating the paths of light rays, it can generate highly realistic images that accurately model global illumination, soft shadows, and complex material interactions.

**Key concepts explored:**
* The rendering equation and Monte Carlo integration
* Unbiased and consistent rendering
* Recursive ray tracing
* Advanced material models (BRDFs)
* Global illumination
* Implementing Mesh Loading
* Reflections and Path tracing
* Direct and Indirect Illumination

### ü§∏ A4: Keyframing & Collision Detection

This project explores the principles of 3D animation and physical simulation. It combines keyframe animation to define motion with collision detection algorithms to handle interactions between objects in a dynamic scene.

**Key concepts explored:**
* Spline-based interpolation for smooth keyframing
* Collision detection algorithms
* Simple physics-based responses to collisions
* Spring Mass systems
